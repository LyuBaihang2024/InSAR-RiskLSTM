# InSAR-RiskLSTM:Enhancing Railway Deformation Risk Prediction with Image-Based Spatial Attention and Temporal LSTM Models

InSAR-RiskLSTM is a Python-based framework designed for railway deformation risk prediction using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. The framework integrates **spatial attention mechanisms**, **LSTM networks**, and a **feature fusion module** to effectively model complex spatio-temporal dependencies.
